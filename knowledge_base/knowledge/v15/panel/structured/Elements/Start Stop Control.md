# Start Stop Control

> Category: `Panel` | Subcategory: `Elements` | Type: `concept`

## Use Case

With the Start Stop Control, you can start and stop a measurement in both online and offline modes.

## Configuration

You can configure the control via the ribbon or the Properties Window.

If you start or stop the measurement from the CANalyzer toolbar, the control indicates the current status.

If you start the measurement via CANoe/CANaylzer step-wise () or if you interrupt the measurement (), you can only stop the measurement using the control. If you want to restart the measurement after the step-wise measurement start or after the measurement interruption, you can only do this via the toolbar.

## Keyboard Operations

The function that is focused (Start or Stop) can be initiated with the space bar.

## Ribbon|Properties Tab / Properties Window

Here all settings are listed that you can change in the ribbon and/or in the Properties Window.
