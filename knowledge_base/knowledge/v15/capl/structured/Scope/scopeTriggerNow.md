> Category: `Scope` | Type: `function`

## Syntax

```c
long scopeTriggerNow();
```

## Description

Performs Trigger Now action for Scope Window. This action is equivalent to immediate triggering via the GUI.

The completion of this action is reported with an internal event which can be awaited via TFS-function testWaitForScopeEvent() in CAPL programs for test modules.

## Example

```c
long res;

res = scopeTriggerNow();
if (res != 1)
{
   testStepFail("Initialization","Call to scopeTriggerNow() failed. Return code =%d", res);
   return;
}

// wait till action done
if (testWaitForScopeEvent(eScopeTriggered, 50000) != 1)
{
   testStepFail("Initialization ","Scope event eScopeTriggered was not received");
   return;
}
testStep("Initialization","Scope hardware triggered successfully");
```
