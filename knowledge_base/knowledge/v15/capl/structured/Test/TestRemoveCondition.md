> Category: `Test` | Type: `function`

## Syntax

```c
long TestRemoveCondition (dword aAuxHandle);
long TestRemoveCondition (char aEventText[]);
```

## Description

Removes an event object or an event text that was added as a condition.

This function can be used both within a test case and also on the test module level.

## Parameters

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| aAuxHandle | Event object, for example a check from the TestService Library. Specified is the handle that is returned when a check is created. |
| aEventText | Textual name of an event whose occurrence should be monitored. This event can be triggered with the function TestSupplyTextEvent. |

## Example

```c
dword checkId;
dword numCheckEvents;

// start the Error Frame observation
checkId = ChkStart_ErrorFramesOccured();
// Add check as condition,
// that means that check violations are reported and
// the verdict of the test case is set to "failed"
TestAddCondition(checkId);
// sequence of different actions and waiting conditions
TestWaitForTimeout(1000);
// Remove check as condition
TestRemoveCondition(checkId);

// stop the check
ChkControl_Stop(checkId);
// reset stored values of the check
ChkControl_Reset(checkId);

// start the check again without adding as condition,
// that means that Error Frames are observed, but violations
// are not reported and do not set the test case verdict to "failed"
ChkControl_Start(checkId);
// sequence of different actions and waiting conditions
TestWaitForTimeout(1000);
// stop the check
ChkControl_Stop(checkId);

// analysis of check
numCheckEvents = ChkQuery_NumEvents(checkId);
if (numCheckEvents > 0)
TestStepFail("Error Frame occurred!");

// destroy check
ChkControl_Destroy(checkId);
```
